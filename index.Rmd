# My Brief Introduction

Hi I am chuhan Wang, trained in medicine at the undergraduate level and I’m now a Biostatistics graduate student at Columbia. 


# My hobbies

During my personal time, I love to go to concerts for fun. Here is a photo of my favorite band from Taiwan named Mayday.

From left to right in the picture, the five people are: guitarist, guitarist, lead vocalist, bassist, and drummer. 


Besides, I’m an avid reader of novels and have even attended my favorite authors’ signing events. And my favorite science-fiction series is Three-Body trilogy. It opens with a secret signal from Cultural Revolution–era China that invites a precarious first contact, then expands through The Dark Forest and Death’s End into a centuries-long, cosmic chess match. I love it for its rigorous physics, eerie sense of scale, and ruthless logic—the way a single elegant idea can doom or save civilizations. It’s equal parts puzzle, prophecy, and awe, and it leaves my brain buzzing long after I finish.


# A fun fact about me

I can recite SpongeBob’s ID number backwards!
