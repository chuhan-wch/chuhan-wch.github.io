# My Brief Introduction

Hi I am chuhan Wang, trained in medicine at the undergraduate level and I’m now a Biostatistics graduate student at Columbia. 

# My hobbies

During my personal time, I love to go to concerts for fun. Here is a photo of my favorite band from Taiwan named Mayday.

From left to right in the picture, the five people are: guitarist, guitarist, lead vocalist, bassist, and drummer. 


Besides, I’m an avid reader of novels and have even attended my favorite authors’ signing events.
